# PDFGenerator

Project completed solely by me during my internship in the summer of 2023 for Columbia Business Professor Jeremy Kagan. My task was to gather data on venture capitalist firms in New York City and compile this data into an attractive PDF. After gathering the data, I used Python's Report Lab library to automate the process of creating the PDFs for hundreds of firms. As I was not authorized to use the real dataset, the firms in this sample CSV were the ones being left out of the final product.
