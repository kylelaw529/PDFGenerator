Blueprint Health,NYC - Soho,,Healthcare,,$20k,3 months,Early to seed,,6%,Brad Weinberg (Partner),"Blueprint Health offers a comprehensive twelve-week program designed to support the growth of startups. Throughout the program, founders are encouraged to relocate to New York City to maximize their program experience. The focus of Blueprint Health is on helping portfolio companies achieve their specific objectives, which typically involve marketing and sales consulting, customer development, and fundraising assistance.

While the program is most beneficial for companies that have already begun generating sales or are in the fundraising phase, Blueprint Health accepts both early-stage startups and those already generating revenue (up to $1M in ARR). Recognizing the importance of sales and investment for startups, Blueprint Health aims to provide support rather than create distractions from these critical goals.

During the program, founders engage in various networking activities to expand their connections, alongside their regular business responsibilities. Blueprint Health strives to ensure that these interactions are meaningful and relevant, while allowing founders ample time to focus on running their companies and acquiring new customers.",https://www.blueprinthealth.org/,,"Adhere Tech---http://www.adheretech.com/, Aidin---http://www.myaidin.com/, Allazo Health---http://www.allazohealth.com/, Amplicare---http://imedicare.com/, Andros---http://www.credsimple.com/, Artemis Health---https://www.blueprinthealth.org/portfolio/ArtemisHealth.com"
